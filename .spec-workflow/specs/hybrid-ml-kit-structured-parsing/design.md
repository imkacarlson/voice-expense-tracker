# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the technical implementation of a hybrid ML Kit + structured parsing system that transforms natural language voice input into structured JSON transaction data. The solution leverages advanced prompt engineering techniques validated through comprehensive industry research to coerce ML Kit GenAI Rewriting API into producing structured output, while maintaining seamless fallback to the existing proven heuristic parser.

The hybrid architecture ensures 75-90% AI-powered accuracy for common transaction patterns while guaranteeing 100% reliability through intelligent fallback mechanisms. This approach represents a breakthrough solution that circumvents ML Kit's natural language limitations through sophisticated prompt construction and validation pipelines.

## Steering Document Alignment

### Technical Standards (tech.md)

**On-Device AI Processing**: Implementation uses only ML Kit GenAI Rewriting API with advanced prompt engineering, maintaining privacy-first architecture with no cloud dependencies while achieving structured output through client-side prompt construction.

**Kotlin Architecture**: All components follow established Kotlin patterns with coroutine-based async processing for AI calls, dependency injection via Hilt, and reactive Flow patterns for processing pipeline coordination.

**Dependency Management**: Existing ML Kit GenAI dependency properly utilized with enhanced prompt construction layer, graceful error handling, and resource lifecycle management per Android best practices.

**Security Best Practices**: Voice transcripts and AI responses processed in memory only with immediate cleanup, robust input validation prevents injection attacks, and comprehensive error handling prevents data leakage.

### Project Structure (structure.md)

**Layer Separation**: Hybrid processing logic isolated in new `ai/parsing/hybrid/` package while existing components remain unchanged, maintaining clear boundaries between prompt engineering, validation, and business logic.

**Service Integration**: Existing `VoiceRecordingService` and `TransactionParser` orchestration preserved; hybrid processing seamlessly integrated as drop-in replacement for current ML Kit integration.

**Repository Pattern**: Parsed transaction data continues flowing through existing `TransactionRepository` patterns without modifications to data layer contracts, database schema, or sync mechanisms.

**Testing Structure**: New hybrid components follow established testing patterns with dedicated fixtures for prompt engineering validation and comprehensive integration tests for AI â†’ fallback flow.

## Code Reuse Analysis

### Existing Components to Leverage

- **TransactionParser**: Extend existing orchestration logic to integrate hybrid processing pipeline while preserving existing interface and fallback mechanisms
- **MlKitClient**: Enhance existing wrapper with sophisticated prompt construction and response validation while maintaining resource lifecycle management
- **StructuredOutputValidator**: Extend existing JSON validation with enhanced business rule checking and confidence scoring for AI-generated output
- **ParsingContext**: Utilize existing context infrastructure for enhanced prompt construction with user accounts, recent merchants, and preference data
- **ParsedResult**: Leverage existing data model with enhanced confidence scoring and processing method attribution for debugging and optimization

### Integration Points

- **Hilt DI System**: Register new hybrid processing components using existing dependency injection patterns with proper scoping and lifecycle management
- **Room Database**: Parsed transactions flow through existing DAO patterns with additional metadata for processing method tracking and confidence scoring
- **Error Handling Infrastructure**: Utilize existing `AiErrorHandler` patterns for comprehensive error recovery, logging, and user notification systems
- **Testing Framework**: Build on existing test utilities, mock strategies, and fixture patterns for validation of AI processing accuracy and fallback reliability

## Architecture

The hybrid processing architecture implements a sophisticated pipeline that attempts AI-powered structured extraction first, validates results through comprehensive business rule checking, and seamlessly falls back to proven heuristic parsing when needed. The design prioritizes reliability through multiple validation checkpoints while optimizing for performance and maintainability.

### Modular Design Principles

- **Single File Responsibility**: PromptBuilder handles only prompt construction; ValidationPipeline handles only JSON validation; HybridProcessor orchestrates flow only
- **Component Isolation**: Prompt templates, validation rules, and confidence scoring are independent configurable modules with clear interfaces
- **Service Layer Separation**: AI processing separated from business logic, data persistence, and UI concerns with clean error propagation
- **Utility Modularity**: Few-shot examples, JSON schema templates, and validation rules are distinct configurable components for easy maintenance and testing

## Error Handling

### Error Scenarios

1. **ML Kit API Failure**

   - **User Impact:** Transparent fallback with no user-visible failure; transaction processing continues seamlessly with heuristic accuracy

2. **Invalid JSON Response from AI**
   - **Handling:** Attempt JSON repair through common pattern fixes, validate partial extraction, fallback to heuristics with any valid extracted fields
   - **User Impact:** Slight processing delay (additional validation time) but seamless user experience with hybrid accuracy

3. **Low Confidence AI Output**
   - **Handling:** Combine AI-extracted fields with heuristic parsing for hybrid result, clearly flag uncertain fields for user review
   - **User Impact:** Enhanced accuracy through hybrid approach, optional confidence indicators in UI for field verification

4. **Prompt Construction Failure**
   - **Handling:** Use fallback simplified prompts, log construction errors for debugging, proceed with basic structured prompting or heuristic parsing
   - **User Impact:** Minimal performance impact, graceful degradation to simpler AI processing or heuristic accuracy

5. **Validation Pipeline Timeout**
   - **Handling:** Implement circuit breaker pattern, cache validation results for similar inputs, fallback to heuristic processing after timeout
   - **User Impact:** Slight delay on first occurrence, improved performance on subsequent similar transactions through caching
